<!ELEMENT CREATIONDATETIME (DD, MMM, YYYY, HH, MM)>

<!ELEMENT NETWORKID (#PCDATA)>
<!-- Only used when third party decides to take responsibility of 
validating and the network of customers. 
In these circumstances if the NetworkID element is not present 
or is set to 0 then the client will have agreed to trust WIN to calculate the NetworkID from :

1) Look for a record of that phone numbers network on the WIN database.
   If not found then ...
2) Look for a match for the prefix of the phone number to an OFTEL lookup. 
   If not found then ...
3) If the message request is for a reverse billed msg then block message.

(Free messages will never be blocked.)  

For certain overseas networks an alternative approach is required for premium rate traffic : 
A CostID must be used with Single Network Routing to the appropriate NetworkID :
